Suggestion on improving your code from team RMBK:

- You could make methods in View package non-static. While it's possible and relatively not difficult to test those methods on their own, static context makes controllers which use them impossible to test.
- In LoginController, it's impossible to test methods that use Scanner as static field. You could consider either changes mentioned above (make View non-static) or to initialize new Scanner inside every method that uses it.
